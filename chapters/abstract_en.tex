\chapter*{Abstract}

While digital audio watermarking is already a widespread practice, most research only concern copyright protection mechanisms. An aim on open information integration is hardly ever a focus of development goals. Yet there are use cases were additional information in audio signals would be of most value. Expecially digital/analog (D/A) conversion processes tend to lose all sorts of metadata, for them not being translated into acoustic signals.
This is where watermarks may come to aid. Also they could be utilized to add additional information to radio and TV broadcast which would make them accessible not only to the reveicing device.

This paper describes the implementations of an existing watermarking algorithm claiming to be capable of enduring D/A conversions. Additionally a framework is proposed to utilize the algorithm in a developed communicaton protocol with synchronization-codes and error-correction mechanisms to provide a well defined, stable communication channel.
